Bitcoin Cash is the solution, as it has fast and low-cost transactions. As the world goes digital, electronic currencies such as Bitcoin Cash are becoming the go-to method for paying online and in retail shops. Third-party providers make it easy to accept Bitcoin Cash using their platforms. When you sign up for a third-party merchant solutions application such as BitPay, you simply setup your account so that you can receive Bitcoin Cash and have it sent to your Bitcoin Cash wallet or you can convert your Bitcoin Cash to your local fiat currency. Most shops do a split where some funds are liquidated to fiat and some are held in crypto. Either way, by setting up a merchant solutions application you can begin accepting Bitcoin Cash payments today without worrying about the complexities of how to accept Bitcoin Cash."

As described in the original Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, P2P cash makes use of digital signatures as part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent fraud. This makes P2P cash a trustless and safe way to transact without the need of intermediaries."
