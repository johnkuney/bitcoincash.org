          The two easiest ways to get Bitcoin Cash is to buy or work for it.
          Buying Bitcoin Cash is the most used and convenient way, where all you
          have to do is sign up for a Bitcoin exchange and deposit funds so you
          can convert it to Bitcoin Cash. The exchange will send you Bitcoin
          Cash after the trade has occurred. The other option is to earn Bitcoin
          Cash by working for it, for example finding a job on a job board that
          pays in Bitcoin Cash or creating your own service (selling t-shirts
          for example) and earning Bitcoin Cash.

          In many cities there is a market of Over The Counter (OTC) traders who
          trade fiat (such as USD, Yen, Euro, etc) for Bitcoin Cash. Or consider
          asking your employer if they would be willing to be at the forefront
          of the future of money and offer partial or complete payment in
          Bitcoin Cash. Some larger cities are also equipped with a Bitcoin Cash
          enabled ATM machine which make it very easy to trade in fiat for
          Bitcoin Cash. Ask at your nearest{" "}
          <Link href="https://events.bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin Cash Meetup</Link>{" "}
          about other options, or consider visiting restaurants in your city
          where you can{" "}

          Buying Bitcoin Cash online is the most popular way to receive Bitcoin
          Cash. Online Exchanges which buy and sell local currency and
          cryptocurrencies allow you to perform bank transfers to trade for
          Bitcoin Cash. Some even accept credit card for immediate purchase. As
          with any online purchase, do your own research and ensure you have a
          your own wallet. We do not recommend leaving any Bitcoin Cash on
          exchanges. You should always store your Bitcoin Cash on your own
          wallet that's been safely backed up.
