                    Peer to peer (P2P) electronic cash is simply described as
                    online money sent from one person to another without the
                    need for a trusted third-party. As described in the original
                    Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, P2P cash makes use
                    of digital signatures as part of the solution, but the main
                    benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required
                    to prevent fraud. This makes P2P cash a trustless and safe
                    way to transact without the need of intermediaries.
