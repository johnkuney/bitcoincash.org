              The goal for Bitcoin Cash is to become sound money that is usable
              by everyone in the world. This is a civilization-changing
              technology which will dramatically increase human freedom and
              prosperity.

            <fbt desc="Explaination of the roadmap">
              This roadmap is intended to provide high-level technical
              direction, and enable different technical teams to work together
              towards a common goal for advancing Bitcoin Cash. The role of
              developers in furthering this goal is to produce high-quality
              professional software that serves the needs of its users, miners
              and merchants. We strive for continuous technical improvement, to
              produce reliable products providing a solid foundation for Bitcoin
              Cash.

              The basic design of Bitcoin Cash is sound. However, this does not
              mean it is perfect. It is prudent to make incremental improvements
              to the system with technically sound design and careful
              engineering. By implementing optimizations and protocol upgrades,
              peer-to-peer digital cash will scale many orders of magnitude
              beyond current limits.

                  mass-parallelization can enable this level of transaction
                  processing.

            <fbt desc="Roadmap's protocol upgrade explaination">
              The Bitcoin Cash network has protocol upgrades twice a year, on
              November 15th and May 15th. These upgrades are required for all
              node operators. They are sometimes referred to as "hard fork
              upgrades", but the term "scheduled protocol upgrades" is
              preferred.

          <p>
            <fbt desc="Roadmap's upgrade activation explaination">
              Rather than a specific block height, the upgrades are based on a
              timestamp. When the median timestamp of the most recent 11 blocks
              (MTP-11) is greater than or equal to UNIX timestamp of November
              15th (or May 15th) 12:00:00 UTC, the new protocol rules take
              effect. This better enables your business to prepare for the
              upgrade at a particular estimated time, plus or minus a few hours.
            </fbt>
          </p>
          <p>
            <fbt desc="Roadmap upgrade future expectation">
              Although this semi-annual upgrade schedule is not expected to
              continue forever, it is in place for the forseeable near-term
              future. Regular protocol upgrades provide a predictable cadence
              for the ecosystem, and are necessary to achieve the vision set
              forth in the roadmap.

            <fbt desc="Roadmap conclusion">
              To become a solid base for application development and innovation,
              Bitcoin Cash must continuously improve and compete. Working
              together, we can build a technical foundation to empower Bitcoin
