Bitcoincash.org is migrating to [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/). If you are new to Gatsby, check out this
bootcamp tutorial on YouTube: [The Great Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM)

### Start developing

#### Setup

```
sudo npm install -g gatsby-cli
npm install
```

#### Start a development server

The server hot-reloads as you make changes.
```
npm run develop
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link for GraphiQL: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

#### Get ready to submit a patch

Before submitting a patch, format your code:
```
npm run format
```

See `package.json { scripts: ... }` for other useful scripts.
